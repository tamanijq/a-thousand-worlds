          <p>We believe in the power of community- that <span class="about-text-highlighted">it takes a village to raise a reader</span>. A reader who is curious, empowered, discerning, joyful and compassionate. <br class="hide-above-725" /><br class="hide-above-725" /><span class="about-text-highlighted">Here at <span style="font-size: 110%;">A THOUSAND WORLDS</span>, we are creating that village</span>

          <p>We are doing this by connecting readers to picture books written and illustrated by BIPOC creatives, <br class="hide-below-972" /> spotlighting the intersectional BIPOC creatives whose books we feature, and <br class="hide-below-900" />
          acknowledging BIPOC leaders in the industry - librarians, editors, parents, authors, teachers, illustrators, and more- <br class="hide-below-1100" />
          by inviting them to curate our directory and partner on programs.</p>

          <p>Our goal is to increase visibility and revenue for BIPOC creatives and decision-makers as a means to shape the future of <br class="hide-below-1135" />
          the childrenâ€™s book industry to be more equitable, interconnected, transparent, creative and inclusive. </p>

          <p>We believe in celebrating differences. We believe in widening the gates of admission. We believe in continuing the evolution <br class="hide-below-1165" />
          of storytelling. We see a world of possibilities, beyond the pages of a picture book.

          <p><span class="about-text-highlighted" style="font-size: 16.8px; line-height: 1.4; display: block; margin-right: -50px;">Imagine a world in which all children see themselves not only in picture books but also in the picture book industry</span>
