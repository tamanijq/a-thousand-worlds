          <p style="text-align: center; position: relative; left: -10px; margin-right: -30px;">We believe in the power of community - that it <span class="about-text-highlighted">takes a village to raise a reader</span> - and here at <span class="about-text-highlighted"><span style="font-size: 110%;">A THOUSAND WORLDS</span>, we are creating this village. </p>

          <p style="margin-right: -20px;">We are doing this with a PICTURE BOOK DIRECTORY. It <span class="about-text-highlighted">connects</span> readers to beautiful picture books written and illustrated <br class="hide-below-1125" />by BIPOC, <span class="about-text-highlighted">spotlights</span> the intersectional BIPOC creatives whose books we feature, and <span class="about-text-highlighted">acknowledges</span> BIPOC leaders in the <br class="hide-below-1175" />industry - librarians, editors, reviewers, authors, teachers and more - by inviting them to curate our directory and partner on programs.</p>

          <p>Our goal is to affect systemic change. We want to increase visibility and revenue for BIPOC creatives and decision-makers as a means to shape the future of the childrenâ€™s book industry to be more equitable.</p>

          <p>Our hope is to bring the world to our young readers in an artful way, via innovative picture books that reflect our world, and in turn raise a reader who is more conscious of the world - diverse, surprising, and remarkable. </p>

          <p>We believe in celebrating differences. We believe in widening the gates of admission. We believe in continuing the evolution of art and storytelling. We see a world of possibilities beyond the pages of a picture book.</p>

          <p><span class="about-text-highlighted" style="font-size: 16.8px; line-height: 1.4; display: block; margin-right: -50px;">Imagine a world in which all children see themselves not only in picture books but also in the picture book industry</span>
